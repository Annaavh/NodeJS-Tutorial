//JS is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded language
//Synchronous - Code executes from top down, with only one line executing at any given time
//Blocking - No matter how long the previous process takes, the next process won't start until the former one is finished
//When web app rtuns in a browser and it executes an intensive amount of code without returning control
//to the browser, the browser can appear to be frozen this is called blocking , the browser is blocked from continuing to handle other tasks until the web app returns the control of proccess
//Single-threaded - A thread is a process that your js program can use to run a task
//each thread can only do one task at a time, js has one thread called the main thread for executing any code
